This week's assignment involved brainstorming ideas for 5 commands to
be used in a Pronto Data Analysis Tool. For each of the commands, use
cases and corresponding component designs were developed. Additionally,
one of the components of the tool, namely a plotting function that
creates a scatter plot of two columns in a specified data frame and
generates a pdf file of the plot was implemented. A series of brief
unit tests were also written to test the functionality of the newly
implemented plot function.

Files submitted:
1) README.md: markdown file containing detailed information on
the use cases and component design for the five features of the
Pronto Data Analysis Tool

2) plot_x_vs_y.py: standalone file containing the implementation of
the scatter plot and pdf creation functionality.

3) plot_x_vs_y_tester.py: unit tests for the aforementioned
scatter plot file

4) Ash_readme: this file, general readme explaining goals
of the week's assignment and submitted files

*5*) pronto_utils.py: discussed in HW_4, included solely for
purpose of access to data download functionality necessary to
run and test the plot function
