CSE 599 - HW 4 - John Ash README

In this homework, the code for the functions in Questions 1 and 2 was written
directly in the pronto_utils.py file. The code for the unit tests was written
in the pronto_utils_tester.py file. An ipython notebook was also created in
order to allow for an "interactive" walkthrough of the homework that provides
some brief explanation on the steps taken to complete it.
